To integrate this package for use in TreeSAPP the following steps must be performed:
1. Replace the current refpkg_code 'Z1111' with:
`treesapp package edit refpkg_code $code --overwrite --refpkg_path /home/connor/Bioinformatics/Hallam_projects/RefPkgs/Photosynthesis/PuhA/seed_refpkg/final_outputs/PuhA_build.pkl` where $code is a unique identifier.
2. Copy /home/connor/Bioinformatics/Hallam_projects/RefPkgs/Photosynthesis/PuhA/seed_refpkg/final_outputs/PuhA_build.pkl to a directory containing other reference packages you want to analyse. This may be in /home/connor/Bioinformatics/Hallam_projects/TreeSAPP_manuscript/treesapp_venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/treesapp//data/ or elsewhere
