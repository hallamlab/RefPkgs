To integrate this package for use in TreeSAPP the following steps must be performed:
1. Write a properly formatted reference package 'refpkg_code' in /home/connor/Bioinformatics/Hallam_projects/RefPkgs/Methanogenesis/MtrA/seed_refpkg/final_outputs/MtrA_build.json, replacing 'Z1111'
2. Copy /home/connor/Bioinformatics/Hallam_projects/RefPkgs/Methanogenesis/MtrA/seed_refpkg/final_outputs/MtrA_build.json to a directory containing other reference packages you want to analyse. This may be in /home/connor/Bioinformatics/Hallam_projects/TreeSAPP_manuscript/treesapp_venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/treesapp//data/ or elsewhere
